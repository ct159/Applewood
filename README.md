This stock market app allows users to buy and sell shares of a particular stock. The app displays the current price of the stock, as well as the user's current funds and the number of shares they currently own.

The user can specify the number of shares they wish to purchase or sell, and then submit the transaction. If the user has sufficient funds, the transaction will go through and their funds and shares will be updated accordingly.

The user's portfolio is also displayed, which lists all the symbols of the stocks they currently own.
